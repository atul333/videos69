## What This Tells You

### ✅ Good Signs
- Seeing `🕐 Old button clicked` means users are engaging with your broadcasts even hours later
- Seeing `✅ Processing anyway` confirms the fix is working
- Seeing video IDs being sent means users are getting content successfully

### 🎯 Insights
- **High number of old button clicks**: Your broadcasts are effective and users save them
- **Fresh button clicks**: Users are actively using the bot in real-time
- **Mix of both**: Healthy user engagement across different time periods

### 🔍 Debugging
If you see:
- `⚠️ Unexpected callback query error:` - This indicates a real problem (not an expired query)
- No video sent after button click - Check channel permissions or video availability

## Real-World Scenario

**Broadcast sent at 1:30 PM:**
```
📢 Hourly broadcast complete! Sent to 150 users, 0 failed
```

**User clicks at 6:45 PM (5+ hours later):**
```
🕐 Old button clicked by User123 (ID: 789456123) - Action: 'next_video'
   ✅ Processing anyway (callback query expired but action will execute)
✅ Sent video message ID 7890 to user 789456123
```

**Result**: ✅ User got their video even though the button was from a 5-hour-old message!
